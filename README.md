## ðŸ’¡Overview:
In this sign language recognition project, we create a   sign detector, which detects alphabets that can very easily be extended to cover a vast multitude of other signs and hand gestures including numbers.

We have developed this project using OpenCV and Keras modules of python.

`Hand Sign Detection` 

Hand detection is a crucial pre-processing procedure for many human hand related computer vision tasks, such as hand pose estimation, hand gesture recognition, human activity analysis, and so on.
Hand Gesture recognition technology  would allow for the operations of complex machines using only series of a finger and hand movements, eliminating the need of physical contact between operator and machine.

`American Sign Language`

It is a complete, natural language that has the same linguistic properties as spokenÂ languages, with grammar that differs from English. ASL is expressed by movements of the hands and face.
